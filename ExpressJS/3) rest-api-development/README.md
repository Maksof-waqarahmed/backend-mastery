üîí Note
This project uses in-memory data only, meaning:
Data will reset when the server restarts.
It‚Äôs ideal for learning & prototyping.
Later you can connect it to a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.

üìå Example API Workflow
GET /books ‚Üí See all books
POST /books ‚Üí Add a new book
GET /books/:id ‚Üí Get specific book
PUT /books/:id ‚Üí Update book
DELETE /books/:id ‚Üí Remove book
